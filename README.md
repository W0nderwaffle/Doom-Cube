# Doom-Cube
A mod for V2.4 designed by the Voron community, for the Voron community! Please note that it is a work in progress, design iterations are expected. The files are hosted on github so we have a log of the past history for the parts.



#### Key features:

-4040 vertical components to allow for insulation with air gap stock

-Top mounted Z drives

-Top mounted low voltage components

-Bottom mounted high voltage components



#### Changes required:

-4pcs 4040 extrusions (HFSB5-4040)

-New Z Idlers



#### Tips for printing parts:

-For any Voron stock parts, or the Z idlers, please use standard settings

-For skirts, etc, you may use other settings to reduce filament usage. Currently I am using: 0.3mm layer height, 2 perimeters, 2 bottom, 3 top, 20% infill.
