# Choosing your DoomCube Frame

## Pre-Drilled vs DIY

Pre-Drilled are, as extrusions appear in the default Voron V2 BOM.

DIY verticals will require drilling through the 4040 extrusion, not unlike the Voron 0 instructions for using MakerBeam. A jig will be provided.

Please reference [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dvbn0rWA60), before ordering any DIY options.

All extrusions are listed using Misumi part numbers.
